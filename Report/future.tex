\section{Future Work}
\label{sec:future}
In this project we looked at two benchmarks. It can be extended to more benchmarks which are more closely suited for application where SQLite is used over PostgreSQL. Databases with bigger size can also be tested, in this project we have used DB sizes of around 1.17GB for TPC-H and 2.5GB for SSB. The project can also extended to create a standalone service that takes SQLite queries and outputs a generic optimised physical plan in a DAG form for other services like Hustle to ingest and execute. 

Also, the query plan generated by SQLite is not as thorough and detailed as PostgreSQL, so it was very difficult to make concrete conclusions in some cases. One can also think about implementing this part so that SQLite outputs better and more detailed logical plan that helps in further analysis.
